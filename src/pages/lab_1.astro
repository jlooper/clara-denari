          The image appears to be burned and is far too dark to read easily. Use a Cloudinary transformation in the Lab to enhance the image's contrast to find your first clue.
          <br/><br/>Create a free account at <a href="https://Cloudinary.com" target="_blank">https://Cloudinary.com</a>. Upload your image to the Media Library. Take note of your <b>cloud name</b> (listed in the top left dropdown menu of the console) and your uploaded image's <b>public ID</b> , which you can find by clicking on the image in the Media Library in the Summary tab.<br/><br/>
          Click the 'Lab' button and enter your cloud name and the image's public ID. Enhance the image which is very dark, but appears to have a word written on it. Hint: try the <a href="https://cloudinary.com/documentation/transformation_reference#e_contrast">'contrast' transformation</a>. Once you have transformed the image, and the word is visible, select the letters from the options in the lab.
