const storyText = `Clara frowned at the paper scrap. At first glance, she thought it was scorched, but as she lifted it closer to the light, she caught the faint sweet, sticky scent.<br/><br/>“This isn’t smoke damage,” she murmured. “It’s… molasses?”
<br/><br/>Clara's eyes widened. “Of course. The Great Molasses Flood of 1919. That sticky tide swept through the North End decades ago. Some warehouses still reek of it when the summer heat hits.”
<br/><br/>Clara traced the paper with her finger. "This means Oscuro must have been hiding out near the old molasses tanks. If that’s where he handled this paper… then the next piece is close by.”`;
